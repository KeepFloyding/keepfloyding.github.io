I am a chemical engineer interested in data science, machine learning and computational modelling. Some brief points about me:

*  Currently working at [Wood PLC](https://www.woodplc.com)
as a Process Analytics engineer where I am responsible for all things data. Check out my blog to see what I am currently working on. 

* I was previously a doctoral researcher at Imperial College London working on building a mathematical model for stroke treatment. My thesis can be found on [Spiral](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/67674) along with one of my papers in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34082-7). 

* Spent some time at ASI Data Science (now [Faculty](https://faculty.ai/)) as a Data Science Fellow and had the opportunity to work with the University of Cambridge. Check out the data science work we did with [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org/)
