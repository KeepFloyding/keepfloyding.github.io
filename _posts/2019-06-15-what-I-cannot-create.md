Welcome to my blog!

I decided to start this blog to showcase my thoughts, notes and observations in fields relevant to my work (data science, chemical engineering, programming and mathematical modelling). I hope to produce short posts that you will hopefully find informative and potentially useful in accomplishing your own projects, whatever they be. To check out my bio, please go the [About](\tabs\about) page. 

As a quick side note, I am writing this blog in `markdown` using Jekyll and hosting it on GitHub with Github Pages. For style, I am using the excellent Chirpy template developed by [Cotes](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), which I can't recommend enough. One of the best features of blogging with Jekyll is the ease and aesthetics of inserting code snippets such as the ones below:

{% highlight python %}
def hello_world()
  print("Hello, World!")
{% endhighlight %}

I hope that you enjoy my site.
