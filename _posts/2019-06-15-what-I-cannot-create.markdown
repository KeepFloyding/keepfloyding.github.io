Hi there, welcome to my blog. I decided to start this blog to showcase my thoughts, notes and observations in my chosen field of expertise (data science and computational modelling). I hope to produce short posts that you will hopefully find informative and useful in accomplishing your own projects, whatever they be. 

To check out my bio, please go the [about](\about) page. 
I am writing this blog in markdown using Jekyll and hosting it in GitHub pages. I can't recommend it enough. One of the best features is the ease and aesthetics of inserting code snippets such as the ones below. 

{% highlight python %}
def hello_world()
  print("Hello, World!")
{% endhighlight %}

I hope that you enjoy my site.
